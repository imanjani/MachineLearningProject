## Categories of clustering algorithms

The algorithms we use fall into three different categories:

* Centroid-based clustering
* Density-based clustering
* Hierarchical clustering

The algorithms used in the Notebook are as follows:

| Category | Algorithm | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Centroid-based | k-means | Find a predetermined number (k) of center points to create k clusters based on distance from center. |
| Centroid-based | mean shift | Seek areas of higher density to determine cluster centers. |
| Density-based | DBSCAN | Separate out the noise (points in sparse regions) and group together data in dense regions. |
| Hierarchical | agglomerative clustering | Start with each point as its own cluster and then merge the nearest cluster until the goal is reached. |
