# Machine Learning Projects


#### 1 - Recommendation Engine with Python (Movie Recommendations)
  - SVD Matrix Factorization
  This method involves embedding movies in a vector space by using a stochastic estimation of Matrix Factorisation. The movie embedding can be considered a representation of the movie features and we can make recommendations using a similarity metric.
  
  - Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering (CF)
   Collaborative filtering (CF) is more commonly used than content-based systems because it usually gives better results and is relatively easy to understand (from an overall implementation perspective). The algorithm has the ability to do feature learning on its own, which means that it can start to learn for itself what features to use.
   CF can be divided into Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering and Model-Based Collaborative filtering.
   Here, I will implement Model-Based CF by using singular value decomposition (SVD) and Memory-Based CF by computing cosine similarity.
